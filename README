The goal of this repo is to reduce the stable diffusion inference pipeline to as few lines of code as possible. For now, it's just the VAE.
After installing the required libraries, run dump.py with -url as argument in order to dump VAE embeddings, dumps will be dumped in the dump folder. To test the autoencoder on test.jpg, run test.py.
